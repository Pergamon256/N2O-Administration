# N2O-tool

UPDATED VERSION COMING SOON (Will allow for predictions based on common patient conditions and beyond just body weight)

This algorithm can be used to determine a patient's nitrous oxide (N2O) flow based on their preexisting conditions, body weight, etc. It can be upgraded to make predictions based on various conditions and illnesses if the appropriate parameters are set in the algorithm.
